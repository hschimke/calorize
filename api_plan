Food/Recipes are basically the same thing.
Foods and recipes need versioning (they have an id for the family and then a current version, each version is its own entry in the table but has a matching family id)
Recipes are just compound foods.
Foods can be a single food or a compound food (a recipe) A meal is much like a recipe
Meals are groups of calories had together (abstract from log)
